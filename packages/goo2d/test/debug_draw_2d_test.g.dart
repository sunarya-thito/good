// One function per fixture this library declares. It is a
// part of that library because a fixture is private, and a
// private class can only be named from inside the library
// that declares it.
//
// The order inside each list is the order the fields would
// have been initialised in, which is the field order of every
// row of that archetype.
//
// A commented-out line is a declaration a mixin from a
// package's lib/ holds privately. That is another library,
// so nothing here can read it - it keeps its place so that
// what the row is missing, and where, is visible.
//
// Beside each list is every type an instance of that fixture
// is, the fixture itself first, then the names in its
// extends, with and implements clauses in that order, each
// followed by its own supertypes. Nothing reads that order
// positionally; it is fixed so two machines write one file.
//
// A type the generator did not read is not listed. A type it
// read and this part cannot name keeps its place as a
// comment - a part writes no imports of its own, so what it
// may name is what its library already does.
